He survived many hardships and tragedies including the loss of six of his younger siblings and five of his children, two major fires at his publishing company and the Halifax Explosion. Through it all, he dedicated himself to his work, raising money through his newspapers to help the wives, widows and children of soldiers of the South African Wars (1879–1915) and victims of the Indian famine of 1899–1900, and the famine in Japan. When he was a senator, he traveled to England and France to personally report on the progress of World War I and Canada's role in it. He was presented to the Queen of England.

      "introduction": "Adam Smith (baptised 16 June [O.S. 5 June] 1723 – 17 July 1790) was a Scottish[a] economist and philosopher who was a pioneer in the field of political economy and key figure during the Scottish Enlightenment. Seen by many as the \"father of economics\" or the \"father of capitalism\", he is primarily known for two classic works: The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776). The latter, often abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, is regarded as his magnum opus, marking the inception of modern economic scholarship as a comprehensive system and an academic discipline. Smith refuses to explain the distribution of wealth and power in terms of divine will and instead appeals to natural, political, social, economic, legal, environmental and technological factors, as well as the interactions among them. The work is notable for its contribution to economic theory, particularly in its exposition of concept of absolute advantage.\n\nBorn in Kirkcaldy, Fife, Smith studied social philosophy at the University of Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by John Snell. Following his graduation, he delivered a successful series of public lectures at the University of Edinburgh, that met with acclaim. This led to a collaboration with David Hume during the Scottish Enlightenment. Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow, where he taught moral philosophy. During this period, he wrote and published The Theory of Moral Sentiments. Subsequently, he assumed a tutoring position that facilitated travel throughout Europe, where he encountered intellectual figures of his era.",
