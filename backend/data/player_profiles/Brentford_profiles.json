He acquired millions of dollars this way; estimates report the amount at between US$15 million and $55 million. Cox's first conviction occurred in 2002 when he was sentenced to probation for mortgage fraud. He then sold the mortgage company he owned in a Tampa, Florida-area firm. He began his life as a dedicated criminal in central Florida after that offense, before fleeing the area when his activities were discovered. His crime spree continued across the southern and southwestern United States, eventually landing him on the United States Secret Service's Most Wanted list. He was aided by several female accomplices, some of whom are in prison or have served time there for their participation in his fraudulent mortgage practices. Cox was arrested on November 16, 2006. Indicted on 42 counts, and facing prison sentences of up to 125 years, he plea bargained his sentence down to a maximum of 54 years on April 11, 2007, and was sentenced to 26 years on November 17, 2007. He was released from prison in July 2019.",
